# Instruction
There are three roles:
1. Administrator (Login: admin / Password: admin1)
2. Driver (Login: driver / Password: driver)
3. Client (Login: client / Password: client)


Registration is open only to clients, the administrator and the driver can only create an administrator.

# Administrator
Can create new users, distribute, delete bonuses and bans. See listings. In the lists, you can delete and view user information.

# Driver
Follows orders. When the order appears, he sees the path and cost of the order. Decides to accept it or not, if the driver accepted the order, he must necessarily complete it. If the client has not continued the order, the driver can cancel it.

# Client
Makes an order. May cancel it if no one has yet accepted, if accepted cancellation is prohibited. It monitors all stages of the driver (the car was found, the car arrived, the trip was completed).
