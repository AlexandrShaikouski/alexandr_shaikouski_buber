# Instruction
There are three characters in the program:

1. Administrator (User ID: admin / Password: admin1)
2. Driver (User ID: driver / Password: driver)
3. Client (User ID: client / Password: client)

Self-registration is only available for clients, to register as a driver you need to contact the administrator.

# Administrator
Can create new users, add, delete bonuses and bans for users. See lists of users, trips. In the lists, you can delete and view user information.

# Driver
Follows orders. When the order appears, he sees the path and cost of the order. Decides to accept it or not, if the driver accepted the order, he must necessarily complete it.

# Client
Places an order. May cancel until the order was accepted. Client canâ€™t cancel the order after it was accepted by a diver. The Buber keeps tracking all stages of the order (the car was found, the car arrived, the trip was completed).
